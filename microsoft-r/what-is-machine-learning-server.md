# Welcome to Machine Learning Server

Machine Learning Server is your flexible choice for analyzing data at scale, building intelligent apps, and discovering valuable insights across your business.  

Machine Learning Server includes a collection of packages, interpreters, and infrastructure for developing and deploying R and Python-based machine learning and data science solutions on a [range of platforms](install/r-server-install-supported-platforms.md), from standalone installs on Linux and Windows, to large distributed deployments on node clusters. 

R support is built on a legacy of Microsoft R Server 9.1 and former Revolution R Enterprise products. Python support is new in this first release of Machine Learning Server. 

## Inside Machine Learning Server

+ R packages
+ Python modules
+ Pretrained models ready to score data you provide
+ Open source distributions of R and Python
+ Interpreters and libraries for running script
+ Analytic deployment and consumption
+ Remote execution
+ Clustered topologies

## Next steps
