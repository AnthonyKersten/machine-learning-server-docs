#### 1. rxMerge() behaviors in RxSpark compute context

*Applies to: RevoScaleR package > rxMerge function*

In comparison with the local compute context, rxMerge() used in a RxSpark compute context has slightly different behaviors:

1.	NULL return value.
2.	Column order may be different.
3.	Factor columns may be written as character type.
4.	In a local compute context, duplicate column names are made unique by adding “.”, plus the extensions provided by the user via the duplicateVarExt parameter (for example “Visibility.Origin”). In an RxSpark compute context, the “.” is omitted.

<a name="revoscaler-rxexecby"></a>

#### 2. rxExecBy() terminates unexpectedly when NA values do not have a factor level

*Applies to: RevoScaleR package > rxExecBy function*

R script using rxExecBy suddenly aborts when the data set presents factor columns containing NA values, and NA is not a factor level. For example, consider a variable for Gender with three factor levels: Female, Male, Unknown. If an existing value is not represented by one of the factors, the function fails.

There are two possible workarounds:

+ Option 1: Add an 'NA' level using **addNA()** to catch the "not applicable" case.
+ Option 2: Clean the input dataset (remove the NA values).

Pseudo code for the first option might be:

`> dat$Gender = addNA(dat$Gender)`

Output would now include a fourth factor level called NA that would catch all values not covered by the other factors:

```R
> rxGetInfo(dat, getVarInfo = TRUE)

Data frame: dat 
Number of observations: 97 
Number of variables: 1 
Variable information: 
Var 1: Gender
       4 factor levels: Female Male Unknown NA
```

#### 3. MicrosoftML error: "Transform pipeline 0 contains transforms that do not implement IRowToRowMapper"

*Applies to: MicrosoftML package > Ensembling*

Certain machine learning transforms that don’t implement the **IRowToRowMapper** interface fail during Ensembling. Examples include getSentiment() and featurizeImage().

To work around this error, you can pre-featurize data using rxFeaturize(). The only other alternative is to avoid mixing Ensembling with transforms that produce this error. Finally, you could also wait until the issue is fixed in the next release.


<a name="ml-ensembling-modelcount"></a>

#### 4. Spark compute context: modelCount=1 does not work with rxTextData

*Applies to: MicrosoftML package > Ensembling*

`modelCount = 1` does not work when used with `rxTextData()` on Hadoop/Spark. To work around this issue, set the property to greater than 1.

<a name="cdh-parcel-message"></a>

#### 5. Cloudera: "install_mrs_parcel.py" does not exist 

If you are performing a [parcel installation of R Server in Cloudera](install/r-server-install-cloudera.md), you might notice a message directing you to use a python installation script for automated deployment. The exact message is "If you wish to automate the Parcel installation please run:", followed by "install_mrs_parcel.py". Currently, that script is not available. Ignore the message.

<a name="cdh-rstudio-loc-cc"></a>

#### 6. Cloudera: Connection error related to libjvm or libhdfs package dependencies

R Server has a package dependency that is triggered only under a very specific configuration:

+ R Server was installed on CDH via parcel generator 
+ RStudio is the IDE
+ Operation runs in local compute context on an edge node in a Hadoop cluster 

Under this configuration, a failed operation could be the result of a package dependency, which is evident in the error message stack through warnings about a missing libjvm or libhdfs package.

The workaround is to recreate the symbolic link, update the site file, and restart R Studio.

1. Create this symlink: 

  ~~~~
  sudo ln -s /usr/java/jdk1.7.0_67-cloudera/jre/lib/amd64/server/libjvm.so /opt/cloudera/parcels/MRS/hadoop/libjvm.so
  ~~~~

2. Copy the site file to the parcel repo and rename it to RevoHadoopEnvVars.site:

  ~~~~
  sudo cp ~/.RevoHadoopEnvVars.site /opt/cloudera/parcels/MRS/hadoop
  sudo mv /opt/cloudera/parcels/MRS/hadoop/.RevoHadoopEnvVars.site /opt/cloudera/parcels/MRS/hadoop/RevoHadoopEnvVars.site
  ~~~~

3. Restart RStudio after the changes:

  ~~~~
  sudo rstudio-server restart
  ~~~~

#### 7. Long delays when consuming web service on Spark

If you encounter long delays when trying to consume a web service created with mrsdeploy functions in a Spark compute context, you may need to add some missing folders. The Spark application belongs to a user called 'rserve2' whenever it is invoked from a web service using mrsdeploy functions. 

To work around this issue, create these required folders for user 'rserve2' in local and hdfs:

```
hadoop fs -mkdir /user/RevoShare/rserve2
hadoop fs -chmod 777 /user/RevoShare/rserve2

mkdir /var/RevoShare/rserve2
chmod 777 /var/RevoShare/rserve2
```

Next, create a new Spark compute context:

```R 
rxSparkConnect(reset = TRUE)
```

When 'reset = TRUE', all cached Spark Data Frames are freed and all existing Spark applications belonging to the current user are shut down.
  If you encounter long delays when trying to consume a web service created with mrsdeploy functions in a Spark compute context, you may need to add some missing folders. The Spark application belongs to a user called “rserve2” whenever it is invoked from a web service using mrsdeploy functions. 

To work around this issue, create these required folders for user “rserve2” in local and hdfs:

```
hadoop fs -mkdir /user/RevoShare/rserve2
hadoop fs -chmod 777 /user/RevoShare/rserve2

mkdir /var/RevoShare/rserve2
chmod 777 /var/RevoShare/rserve2
```

Now, to create a clean Spark compute context, then run:

```R 
rxSparkConnect(reset = TRUE)
```

The 'reset' parameter kills all pre-existing yarn applications, and create a new one.

### Microsoft R Server 9.0.1

#### Package: RevoScaleR > Distributed Computing
 + On SLES 11 systems, there have been reports of threading interference between the Boost and
MKL libraries.
 + The value of consoleOutput that is set in the `RxHadoopMR` compute context when `wait=FALSE`
determines whether or not `consoleOutput` is displayed when `rxGetJobResults` is called; the
value of `consoleOutput` in the latter function is ignored.
 + When using `RxInTeradata`, if you encounter an intermittent failure, try resubmitting your
R command.
 + The `rxDataStep` function does not support the `varsToKeep` and `varsToDrop` arguments in
`RxInTeradata`.
 + The `dataPath` and `outDataPath` arguments for the `RxHadoopMR` compute context are not yet
supported.
 + The `rxSetVarInfo` function is not supported when accessing xdf files with the `RxHadoopMR`
compute context.
 + When specifying a non-default `RNGkind` as an argument to `rxExec`, identical random number streams can be generated unless the `RNGseed` is also specified.
 + When using small test data sets on a Teradata appliance, some test failures may occur due to insufficient data on each AMP.
 + Adding multiple new columns using `rxDataStep` with `RxTeradata` data sources fails in local compute context. As a workaround, use `RxOdbcData` data sources or the `RxInTeradata` compute context.


#### Package: RevoScaleR > Data Import and Manipulation
 + Appending to an existing table is not supported when writing to a Teradata database.
 + When reading `VARCHAR` columns from a database, white space is trimmed. To prevent this,
enclose strings in non-white-space characters.
 + When using functions such as `rxDataStep` to create database tables with `VARCHAR` columns, the
column width is estimated based on a sample of the data. If the width can vary, it may be
necessary to pad all strings to a common length.
 + Using a transform to change a variable's data type is not supported when repeated calls to
`rxImport` or `rxTextToXdf` are used to import and append rows, combining multiple input files
into a single .xdf file.
 + When importing data from the Hadoop Distributed File System, attempting to interrupt the
computation may result in exiting the software.

#### Package: RevoScaleR > Analysis Functions
 + Composite xdf data set columns are removed when running `rxPredict(.)` with `rxDForest(.)` in
Hadoop and writing to the input file.
 + The `rxDTree` function does not currently support in-formula transformations; in particular, using
the `F()` syntax for creating factors on the fly is not supported. However, numeric data is automatically binned.
 + Ordered factors are treated the same as factors in all RevoScaleR analysis functions except
`rxDTree`.

#### Package: RevoIOQ

 + If the `RevoIOQ` function is run concurrently in separate processes, some tests may fail.

#### Package: RevoMods
 + The `RevoMods` timestamp() function, which masks the standard version from the utils package, is unable to find the `C_addhistory` object when running in  an Rgui, Rscript, etc. session. If you are calling `timestamp()`, call the `utils` version directly as `utils::timestamp()`.

#### R Base and Recommended Packages
+ In the `nls` function, use of the `port` algorithm occasionally causes the R front end to stop unexpectedly. The `nls` help file advises caution when using this algorithm. We recommend avoiding it altogether and using either the default Gauss-Newton or plinear algorithms.

#### Operationalize (Deploy & Consume Web Services) _features formerly referred to as DeployR_

+ When Azure active directory authentication is the only form of authentication enabled, it is not possible to run diagnostics.

### Microsoft R Server 8.0.5

#### Package: RevoScaleR > Distributed Computing
 + On SLES 11 systems, there have been reports of threading interference between the Boost and
MKL libraries.
 + The value of consoleOutput defined in the `RxHadoopMR` compute context when `wait=FALSE` determines whether `consoleOutput` is displayed when `rxGetJobResults` is called. The
value of `consoleOutput` in the latter function is ignored.
 + When using `RxInTeradata`, if you encounter an intermittent failure, try resubmitting your
R command.
 + The `rxDataStep` function does not support the `varsToKeep` and `varsToDrop` arguments in
`RxInTeradata`.
 + The `dataPath` and `outDataPath` arguments for the `RxHadoopMR` compute context are not yet
supported.
 + The `rxSetVarInfo` function is not supported when accessing xdf files with the `RxHadoopMR`
compute context.

#### Package: RevoScaleR > Data Import and Manipulation
 + Appending to an existing table is not supported when writing to a Teradata database.
 + When reading `VARCHAR` columns from a database, white space is trimmed. To prevent this,
enclose strings in non-white-space characters.
 + When using functions such as `rxDataStep` to create database tables with `VARCHAR` columns, the
column width is estimated based on a sample of the data. If the width can vary, it may be
necessary to pad all strings to a common length.
 + Using a transform to change a variable's data type is not supported when repeated calls to
`rxImport` or `rxTextToXdf` are used to import and append rows, combining multiple input files
into a single .xdf file.
 + When importing data from the Hadoop Distributed File System, attempting to interrupt the
computation may result in exiting the software.

#### Package: RevoScaleR > Analysis Functions
 + Composite xdf data set columns are removed when running `rxPredict(.)` with `rxDForest(.)` in
Hadoop and writing to the input file.
 + The `rxDTree` function does not currently support in-formula transformations; in particular, using
the `F()` syntax for creating factors on the fly is not supported. However, numeric data is automatically binned.
 + Ordered factors are treated the same as factors in all RevoScaleR analysis functions except
`rxDTree`.

#### DeployR

 + On Linux, if you attempt to change the DeployR RServe port using the `adminUtilities.sh`, the script incorrectly updates Tomcat's `server.xml` file, which prevents Tomcat from starting, and does not update the necessary the `Rserv.conf` file. You must revert back to an earlier version of `server.xml` to restore service.

 + Using `deployrExternal()` on the DeployR Server to reference a file that in a specified folder produces a ‘Connection Error’ due to an improperly defined environment variable. For this reason, you must log into the Administration Console and go to **The Grid** tab. In that tab, edit **Storage Context value for each and every node** and specify the **full path** to the external data directory on that node’s machine, such as `<DEPLOYR_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>/deployr/external/data`.

#### RevoIOQ Package

 + If the `RevoIOQ` function is run concurrently in separate processes, some tests may fail.

#### RevoMods Package
 + The `RevoMods` timestamp() function, which masks the standard version from the utils package, is unable to find the `C_addhistory` object when running in  an Rgui, Rscript, etc. session. If you are calling `timestamp()`, call the `utils` version directly as `utils::timestamp()`.

#### R Base and Recommended Packages
+ In the nls function, use of the `port` algorithm occasionally causes the R front end to stop unexpectedly. The nls help file advises caution when using this algorithm. We recommend avoiding it altogether and using either the default Gauss-Newton or plinear algorithms.
