# `RxRemoteJob`


**Applies to: SQL Server 2017 RC2**



```
revoscalepy.RxRemoteJob(compute_context: revoscalepy.computecontext.RxComputeContext.RxComputeContext,
    job_id: str = None)
```





```
close()
```




Closes the remote job, purging all the data associated with the job



```
deserialize_job(job_id: str) -> revoscalepy.computecontext.RxRemoteJob.RxRemoteJob
```




Deserializes a RxRemoteJob given the job id


# Returns

The job that was deserialized



```
deserialize_jobs() -> list
```




Deserializes the existing jobs that have not been cleaned up by calling close().


# Returns

The deserialized jobs



```
resolve_context() -> revoscalepy.computecontext.RxComputeContext.RxComputeContext
```




Resolves the `RxComputeContext` that is associated with the job


# Returns

The `RxComputeContext` that is associated with the job or `None` if the compute context isnâ€™t valid
