# R Function Library Reference

This section contains the function reference documentation for proprietary *revo* packages installed with Microsoft R Client and R Server, or available in an Azure service that provides R functionality. Each package offers functions used for specific categories of operations. 

You can use these libraries and functions in combination with other open source or third-party packages, but to use the *revo* packages, your R code must run against a service or on a computer that has a Microsoft R installation.

| Library details | |
|--------|-|
| [Supported platforms:](../install/r-server-install-supported-platforms.md) | Hadoop MapReduce</br>Hadoop Spark</br>Linux</br> SQL Server (Windows only)</br>Windows|
| Built on: | R 3.3.x (included when you [install a product](#how-to-install) that provides this package). |

## R function libraries

|Package | Version | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
|[MicrosoftML](microsoftml/microsoftml-package.md) | 1.3.0  | A collection of functions in Microsoft R used for machine learning operations, including training and transformations, scoring, text and image analysis, and feature extraction for deriving values from existing data.|
|[mrsdeploy](mrsdeploy/mrsdeploy-package.md) | 1.1.0 | Deployment functions for interactive remote execution at the command line, plus web service functions for bundling R code blocks as discrete web services that can be deployed and managed on an R Server instance. Formally known as DeployR. |
|[olapR](olapr/olapr.md) | 1.0.0 | A collection of functions for constructing MDX queries against an OLAP cube. Runs only on the Windows platform.|
|RevoIOQ | 8.0.6 | Installation and Operational Qualification test functions, used in conjunction with the RUnit package to run a set of unit tests. It has only one user-facing function, also called **RevoIOQ**. Reference documentation is online only (<sup> 1 </sup>). |
|RevoMods | 11.0.0 | Microsoft modifications and extensions to standard R functions. Reference documentation is online only (<sup> 1 </sup>).  |
|[RevoPemaR](revopemar/pemar.md) | 10.0.0 | Developer functions for coding custom parallel external memory algorithms. |
|[RevoScaleR](revoscaler/revoscaler.md) | 9.1.0 | Data acquisition, manipulation and transformations, visualization, and analysis. RevoScaleR provides functions for the full range of statistical and analytical tasks. It's the backbone of [R Server](../what-is-microsoft-r-server.md) functionality. |
|RevoTreeView | 10.0.0 | Decision tree functions, including the **rxDTree** function. Reference documentation is online only (<sup> 1 </sup>). |
|[RevoUtils](revoutils/revoutils.md) | 10.0.3 | Utility functions useful when programming and developing R packages.|
|RevoUtilsMath | 10.0.0 | Microsoft's distribution of the Intel Math Kernal Library (MKL). Reference documentation is online only (<sup> 1 </sup>). |
|[sqlrutils](sqlrutils/sqlrutils.md) | 1.0.0 | A collection of functions for executing stored procedures against SQL Server.|

<sup> 1 </sup> Learn more about this package by typing ?"packagename" in the RGUI.exe console window or in the R Help page in your preferred R IDE, such as **R Tools for Visual Studio**.

## How to get packages

The packages documented in this section are found only on installations of the Microsoft products or Azure services that provide them. Setup programs or scripts install the propertietary R packages from Microsoft and any package dependencies. Unless noted otherwise, all of the packages listed in the preceding table are installed with the product or service.

By default, packages are installed in the \Program Files\Microsoft\R Server\R_SERVER\library folder on Windows, and in the /usr/lib64/microsoft-r folder on the Linux native file system.

Ships in: 
+ [Microsoft R Client (Windows and Linux)](../r-client/what-is-microsoft-r-client.md) 
+ [Microsoft R Server (all platforms)](../what-is-microsoft-r-server.md)   
+ [SQL Server 2016 and later (Windows only)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/advanced-analytics/getting-started-with-machine-learning-services)   
+ [Azure HDInsight](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-r-server-get-started)  
+ [Azure Data Science Virtual Machines](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-data-science-provision-vm)  

## How to list packages and versions

To get the version of an R package installed on your computer, open an R console application and execute the following command: `installed.packages()`

To determine the version of the package, open its help page to view the version number just under the title: `library(help="<package-name>")`

## How to view built-in help pages

Most R packages come with built-in help pages that open in separate window.

1. Open an R console tool, such as Rgui.exe or another R IDE.
2. List the packages using `installed.packages()`
3. Open help for a specific package using: `library(help="<package-name>")`
4. Open help for a specific funtion using: `?<function_name>`

R is case-sensitive. Be sure to type the package name using the correct case: for example, `library(help = "RevoScaleR")`.

## Deprecated & discontinued packages

The following packages exist for backward compatibility but are no longer under active development:

* RevoRpeConnector
* RevoRsrConnector
* revolpe

For a list of deprecated or discontinued functions within an existing package, see [Release notes for R Server](../resources-deprecated-features.md).

## Next steps

First, read the introduction to each package to learn about common use case scenarios:

+ [MicrosoftML](microsoftml/microsoftml-package.md) 
+ [mrsdeploy](mrsdeploy/mrsdeploy-package.md)   
+ [olapR](olapr/olapr.md)   
+ [RevoPemaR](revopemar/pemar.md)   
+ [RevoScaleR](revoscaler/revoscaler.md)  
+ [RevoUtils](revoutils/revoutils.md)   
+ [sqlrutils](sqlrutils/sqlrutils.md)   

Next, add these the packages by installing [R Client](../r-client/what-is-microsoft-r-client.md) or [R Server](../what-is-microsoft-r-server.md). R Client is free. R Server developer edition is also free.

Lastly, follow these tutorials for hands on experience:

+ [Explore R and RevoScaleR in 25 functions](../r/tutorial-r-to-revoscaler.md)  
+ [Quickstart: Run R Code in Microsoft R](../r/quickstart-run-r-code.md)
