 #rxRemovePackages: Remove Packages from Compute Context

 Applies to version 9.1.0 of package RevoScaleR.
 
 ##Description
 
**NOTE: This new API is in pre-release mode and subject to change before final release.**

Removes installed packages from a compute context.
 
 
 ##Usage

```   
  
  rxRemovePackages(pkgs, lib, dependencies = TRUE, checkReferences = TRUE,
      verbose = getOption("verbose"), scope = "private", owner = '', computeContext = rxGetOption("computeContext"))
 
```
 
 ##Arguments

   
  
    
 ### pkgs
 a `character` vector of names of the packages to be removed. 
   
  
    
 ### lib
 a `character` vector  identifying library path from where the package needs to be removed. This argument is not supported in [RxInSqlServer](rxinsqlserver.md) compute context. Only valid for local compute context. 
   
   
    
 ### dependencies
 logical. Applicable only for [RxInSqlServer](rxinsqlserver.md) compute context. If `TRUE`, does dependency resolution of the packages being removed and removes the dependent packages also if the dependent packages aren't referenced by other packages outside the dependency closure.  
  
  
    
 ### checkReferences
 logical. Applicable only for [RxInSqlServer](rxinsqlserver.md) compute context. If `TRUE`, verifies there are no references to the dependent packages by other packages outside the dependency closure.  
  
  
    
 ### verbose
 logical. If `TRUE`, "progress report" is given during removal of given packages. 
  
  
    
 ### scope
 character. Applicable only for [RxInSqlServer](rxinsqlserver.md) compute context. Should be either `"shared"` or `"private"`.  `"shared"` removes the packages from per database shared location on SQL server which in turn could have been used (referred) by multiple different users. `"private"` removes the packages from per database, per user private location on SQL server which is only accessible to the single user. 
  
  
    
 ### owner
 character. Applicable only for [RxInSqlServer](rxinsqlserver.md) compute context. This is generally empty `''` value.  Should be either empty `''` or a valid SQL database user account name. Only users in `'db_owner'` role for a database can specify this value to remove packages on  behalf of other users.  
  
  
    
 ### computeContext
 an [RxComputeContext](rxcomputecontext.md) or equivalent character string or `NULL`.   If set to the default of `NULL`, the currently active compute context is used. Supported compute contexts are [RxInSqlServer](rxinsqlserver.md), [RxLocalSeq](rxlocalseq.md). 
  
  
 
 
 ##Details
 
This is a simple wrapper for remove.packages. 
For [RxInSqlServer](rxinsqlserver.md) compute context the user specified as part of connection string is used for removing the packages if `owner` argument is empty. The user calling this function needs to be granted permissions by database owner by making them member of either `'rpkgs-shared'` or `'rpkgs-private'` database role. Users in `'rpkgs-shared'` role can remove packages from `"shared"` location and their own `"private"` location. Users in `'rpkgs-private'` role can only remove packages from their own `"private"` location.

See the help file for additional details.
 
 
 
 ##Value
 
Invisible `NULL`

 ##Examples

 ```
   
  ## Not run:
 
#
# create SQL compute context
#
sqlcc <- RxInSqlServer(connectionString = 
    "Driver=SQL Server;Server=myServer;Database=TestDB;Trusted_Connection=True;")

pkgs <- c("dplyr")

#
# Remove a package and its dependencies after checking references from private scope
#
rxRemovePackages(pkgs = pkgs, verbose = TRUE, scope = "private", computeContext = sqlcc)

#
# Remove a package and its dependencies after checking references from shared scope
#
rxRemovePackages(pkgs = pkgs, verbose = TRUE, scope = "shared", computeContext = sqlcc)

#
# Forcefully remove a package and its dependencies without checking references from 
# private scope
#
rxRemovePackages(pkgs = pkgs, checkReferences = FALSE, verbose = TRUE, 
  scope = "private", computeContext = sqlcc)

#
# Force fully remove a package without its dependencies and without 
# any references checking from shared scope private scope
#
rxRemovePackages(pkgs = pkgs, dependencies = FALSE, checkReferences = FALSE, 
  verbose = TRUE, scope = "shared", computeContext = sqlcc)

#
# Remove a package and its dependencies from private scope for user1
#
rxRemovePackages(pkgs = pkgs, verbose = TRUE, scope = "private", owner = "user1", computeContext = sqlcc)

#
# Remove a package and its dependencies from shared scope for user1
#
rxRemovePackages(pkgs = pkgs, verbose = TRUE, scope = "shared", owner = "user1", computeContext = sqlcc)
