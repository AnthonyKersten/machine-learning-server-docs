# Introducing Machine Learning Server on HDInsight

By running Machine Learning Server as a service on top of HDInsight, Machine Learning Server for HDInsight achieves unprecedented scale and performance by combining enterprise-scale R and Python analytics software with the power of Hadoop and Spark. Multi-threaded math libraries and transparent parallelization in Machine Learning Server means handling up to 1000x more data and up to 50x faster speeds than open source Râ€”helping you train more accurate models for better predictions than previously possible. Plus, because Machine Learning Server is built to work with Python and the open source R language, all of your scripts can run without changes.
