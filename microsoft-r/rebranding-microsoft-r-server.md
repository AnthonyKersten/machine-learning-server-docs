# Microsoft R Server is now Machine Learning Server

In September 2017, Microsoft R Server was released under the new name of **Machine Learning Server 9.2**. The rebranding reflects that Python has joined R on the list of supported languages and capabilities. The R capabilities have also been enhanced. There is no loss of functionality for users of a prior R Server release.

[Read the "What's new in this release."](whats-new-in-machine-learning-server.md)

## Our commitment to R is unchanged

Microsoft continues its commitment to R not only in the latest Machine Learning Server release, but also in the newest [Microsoft R Client](r-client/what-is-microsoft-r-client.md) and [Microsoft R Open](https://mran.microsoft.com) releases.

## Upgrade to Machine Learning Server

Upgrading from R Server to Machine Learning Server is as easy as ever. The R analytics and web services you developed under R Server will continue to work under Machine Learning Server.

1. Follow these instructions to upgrade to Machine Learning Server on [Windows](heidi-to-provide.md), [Linux](heidi-to-provide.md), and [Hadoop](heidi-to-provide.md). 

1. Don't forget to [upgrade your web and compute nodes](operationalize/configure-start-for-administrators.md#configure-server-for-operationalization) if you are operationalizing your analytics.


Note that _Microsoft R Server 9.1 for Teradata_ was the last release and will not have a Machine Learning Server equivalent.

## Get support for R Server

Microsoft is committed to providing customers with support. Microsoft R Server support continues in these ways: 
+ [Review our servicing support timeline](resources-servicing-support.md)

+ [Post in our user forum](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=MicrosoftR)  

## The future of Microsoft R Client

[Microsoft R Client](r-client/what-is-microsoft-r-client.md) was not rebranded and continues as an R-only client for Machine Learning Server and R Server. 

A Python interpreter can also be installed locally along with the custom Python libraries to gain similar functionality. [Learn more](install/python-libraries-interpreter.md).
