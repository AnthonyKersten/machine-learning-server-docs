# Restoring & Backing Up the Database

You can back up and restore the DeployR database through the **Database** tab in the Administration Console.

In this tab, you can export the contents of the database used by DeployR into a ZIP file as a way to backup data or as the first step in migrating data between two or more DeployR-server instances. You can also import this content into the repository on this server instance from a previously exported ZIP file.
